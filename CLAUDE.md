# The Orb OS — CLAUDE.md

> Named Capsule Radar until August 2026, and Plane Radar 2.0 before that. The rename
> is display-only: the NVS namespace is still `capsuleradar` and always will be, the
> mDNS name became `theorb.local` in 1.40, and the repo folder became `orb-os` on 2026-08-30
> (origin was already `Ziplock78/orb-firmware`; `upstream` still points at socquique/capsule-radar).
> See the note on the namespace in main.cpp before touching any of those.
>
> The inherited product documents are gone as of 1.42: `docs/LISTING.md`,
> `docs/MAKERWORLD.md` and `docs/FEATURES.md` described Quique Tortosa's flight-radar
> gadget, not this, and README's body has been rewritten. One reference remains and is
> deliberate: the community port credited at the bottom of README carries its own name,
> because it is a third party's project.

Master context for Claude Code. Read this first, then `docs/` for detail.

> **Adding or extending a screen? Read `docs/adding-a-screen.md` first.**
> A screen is a firmware feature plus a design surface in Orb Studio, and it is only
> finished when both halves agree. That file is the checklist of the standard parts every
> screen has — background, glass, per-slot typefaces, the full set of text controls,
> margins, version keys, capability level — written after the Headlines screen shipped
> without five of them and had to be repaired one complaint at a time.

## The launch plan lives outside this repo

Read both of these before starting work. They are the scope, and neither is in this
repository:

- `~/Developer/agentic-os/data/documents/plans/orb-launch-one-cut-list.md`
  What must be true to ship launch one. Finite and numbered `CUT-nn`. If a job does not
  serve an item on that list, it is not launch work, and saying so is more useful than
  doing it.
- `~/Developer/agentic-os/data/documents/plans/orb-ux-requirements.md`
  The destination, numbered `UX-nnn`. The cut list cites these ids.

When work closes or changes a cut list item, name it by number.

## How work is done here

Six rules. They exist because each one was learned by nearly getting it wrong.

1. **Firmware runs on a real Orb before it reaches Studio.** `publish-firmware.sh` stages a
   binary; `wrangler deploy` is what hands it to strangers. Never run the deploy on a build
   that has not booted on hardware, however clean the audit is.
2. **One cut list item, one commit.** Never start a second item on top of the first one's
   uncommitted work. Two items in one pile cannot be undone separately.
3. **Personal permissions go in `.claude/settings.local.json`.** Never `settings.json`, which
   is not gitignored and would ship to anyone who clones this repo.
4. **Name the `CUT-nn` a change serves.** If it serves none, say so before doing it rather
   than after.
5. **A regression found in your own recent commit outranks the task in hand.** Say it plainly
   and early, the way the GPS re-centre guard was caught.

6. **When something must never happen, make the shared path enforce it.** A warning beside
   one call site protects one call site. Three faults this week were a lesson written where it
   last happened: the enum comment that said not to renumber and lost, the WiFi
   credential write whose 2026-08-15 note sat beside the old caller while Settings walked into
   the same function from the other side, and a manifest import that looked free to the second
   person exactly as it had to the first. A comment cannot fail. A guard can.

## What we're building
A live ADS-B aircraft radar for the **Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75** (round 466×466 AMOLED, capacitive touch). It's an evolution of the classic 240×240 GC9A01 "plane radar": same idea (pull nearby aircraft from an online ADS-B feed over WiFi, plot them on a radar scope centered on the user), but redesigned for a full-color high-res round AMOLED with touch, IMU, RTC and a speaker.

There is NO fixed visual target any more, and this is the single biggest way this project
has diverged from the one it forked. `assets/plane_radar_2.0_mockup.html` is upstream's
mockup of a phosphor-green radar scope and it is kept only as history: it describes one of
several stock skins, not the look of this firmware.

The look is the THEME's, and the theme is a folder on the SD card designed in Orb Studio.
Backgrounds, glass, typefaces, colours, opacity, glow, layer order and layout all belong to
the design rather than to the code. When something on screen looks wrong, the first question
is whether the firmware drew it wrong or the theme asked for it, and the second is whether
Orb Studio's preview agreed with either.

## Hardware (summary — full detail in docs/HARDWARE.md)
- MCU: ESP32-S3R8, 8 MB PSRAM, 16 MB flash, dual-core 240 MHz, WiFi + BLE5.
- Display: CO5300 AMOLED, 466×466, QSPI. Brightness via panel command (no PWM backlight pin).
- Touch: CST9217, I2C.
- IMU: QMI8658 (I2C). RTC: PCF85063 (I2C). PMIC: AXP2101 (I2C 0x34). Audio: ES8311 codec + speaker, dual mic.
- **Verified pins**: LCD_CS=12, LCD_RST=39, TP_INT=11, TP_RST=40, touch mirror_x/y = true.
- **Pins still to confirm from the official demo**: QSPI SCLK + D0..D3, and the shared I2C SDA/SCL. Do NOT guess these — copy them from the Waveshare Arduino factory demo (see below). They are left as `-1` placeholders in `src/config.h`.

## Stack decision
**PlatformIO + Arduino framework.** Libraries:
- `moononournation/GFX Library for Arduino` (Arduino_GFX) — CO5300 QSPI panel driver + framebuffer.
- `lvgl/lvgl` (v8.x or v9.x) — UI screens, touch input, widgets.
- `bblanchon/ArduinoJson` (v7) — parse the ADS-B feed.
- WiFi / WiFiClientSecure / HTTPClient (built-in).

ESP-IDF is a valid alternative (Waveshare ships IDF demos too) but Arduino is the faster path here and has the most community examples for this board. If we switch, only the driver/UI glue changes; `geo.*`, `adsb_client.*` logic and the data model port directly.

### Official Waveshare Arduino demos to crib from (do this first)
The board's wiki ships these examples — clone them and lift the exact init code:
- `01_HelloWorld` → CO5300 + Arduino_GFX databus pins (THIS gives us the missing QSPI/I2C pins).
- `03_LVGL_PCF85063_simpleTime` → RTC + LVGL wiring.
- `04_LVGL_QMI8658_ui` → IMU read.
- `05_LVGL_AXP2101_ADC_Data` → battery/PMIC.
- `06_LVGL_Widgets` → LVGL config reference (`lv_conf.h`).
- `08_ES8311` → audio codec init (for the alert "ping").

## Data source (full detail in docs/DATA_SOURCE.md)
**airplanes.live** free REST API. Query by position + radius:
`GET https://api.airplanes.live/v2/point/{lat}/{lon}/{radius_nm}`
Returns JSON with an aircraft array (key `ac`, readsb format). Fields we use: `hex`, `flight`, `lat`, `lon`, `alt_baro`, `track`/`true_heading`, `gs`, `baro_rate`, `squawk`, `seen_pos`.
- **Educational / non-commercial use only** — that's exactly this project. Be polite: ~1 request / 1–2 s, set a descriptive User-Agent.
- Fallback: **adsb.lol** (`https://api.adsb.lol/v2/point/...`, same format).
- Avoid OpenSky for now (OAuth2 + tighter limits, awkward on-device).

## Architecture (full detail in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Core 0 task** (`adsb_task`): WiFi keepalive, fetch + parse the feed every `POLL_INTERVAL_MS`, write into a shared `std::vector<Aircraft>` guarded by a FreeRTOS mutex.
- **Core 1 / Arduino loop**: LVGL tick + render. Reads the aircraft list under the mutex, projects lat/lon → screen (see `geo.*`), draws the scope, sweep, trails, glyphs, labels and the active detail card.
- 8 MB PSRAM easily holds a full RGB565 framebuffer (466×466×2 ≈ 434 KB) and double-buffer; allocate LVGL draw buffers in PSRAM.
- Settings (WiFi creds, home lat/lon, range, units, theme) in NVS (`Preferences`). First-boot **captive portal** (WiFiManager) to enter them. **OTA** via ArduinoOTA.

## Build / flash

**A firmware change is not finished when it compiles.** `pio run` puts a binary in
`.pio/build/`, where nothing can reach it. Zion flashes from Orb Studio, and Studio decides
whether to offer an update by comparing version STRINGS. So a changed binary under an
unchanged `FW_VERSION` is invisible: his Orb says 1.63.1, the bundle says 1.63.1, Studio says
"firmware is up to date", and there is no button to press. This has now wasted his time
several times, and each time it looked like the flasher was broken when nothing was broken.

Three steps, every time, or the work does not exist:

```
# 1. bump FW_VERSION in src/config.h            <- the step that keeps getting skipped
# 2. build + copy into Studio's bundle + write the manifest
bash tools/publish-firmware.sh
# 3. rebuild and deploy Studio, or it keeps serving the old bundle
cd ~/Developer/hf-sites/buildtheorb/app && npx vite build && npx wrangler deploy --name buildtheorb
```

`publish-firmware.sh` now refuses step 2 if the binary moved and `FW_VERSION` did not, and
tells you after step 2 if step 3 is still outstanding. Neither guard fires if nobody runs the
script, which is why this is written here as well.

Local build and flash, for working on the device directly:
```
pio run                        # build
pio run -t upload              # flash over USB-C
pio device monitor -b 115200   # serial
```
First make the Waveshare `01_HelloWorld` equivalent light up, then bring this scaffold's pins in line and build upward through the milestones.

## Roadmap (suggested milestones)
- **M0 — Bring-up**: get the official HelloWorld/LVGL widgets demo running; copy verified databus + I2C pins into `config.h`. Backlight + touch + a "hello" screen.
- **M1 — Static scope**: draw rings, crosshair, N/E/S/W, center dot, animated sweep. Match the mockup palette on true-black AMOLED.
- **M2 — Live data**: WiFi + captive portal; `adsb_client` fetch/parse; project aircraft to screen; glyphs rotated by `track`; altitude color map; fading trails.
- **M3 — Touch & detail**: hit-test nearest glyph on tap → detail card (callsign, type, alt, gs, vs, dist, bearing, squawk). Swipeable views: radar / list / stats.
- **M4 — Polish**: range zoom; north-up vs track-up; emergency/military/type alerts + speaker ping; idle auto-dim; IMU face-down sleep / shake-to-refresh; OTA; persist settings.

## Conventions & guardrails
- C++17. Keep the render path non-blocking — no network or `delay()` in the LVGL loop; all I/O lives in `adsb_task`.
- Touch the shared aircraft vector only under `xSemaphoreTake(g_ac_mutex, ...)`.
- All tunables live in `config.h`. No magic numbers in render code.
- HTTPS: for a hobby device `WiFiClientSecure::setInsecure()` is acceptable; a pinned root cert is the "proper" option — note the choice in code.
- **Never invent the unknown GPIO pins.** They come from the official demo. Placeholders are `-1` and the build should assert/log if they're still `-1`.
- API is non-commercial; keep request cadence gentle and User-Agent honest.
