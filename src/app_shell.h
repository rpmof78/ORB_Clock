// The app shell: the "channel changer". Holds an ordered list of full-screen
// apps (each is one LVGL screen) and flips between them when the knob turns.
// Turn right -> next app, turn left -> previous app; the list wraps around.
// Per-app knob handlers. onPress = a push; onTurn = a detent while the app has
// "captured" the knob (used by menus that scroll with the knob instead of switching
// apps). An app that captures the knob keeps it until it calls next()/prev() itself.
// onExit fires right before the shell switches away to a different app — the
// counterpart to onEnter — so an app can drop memory it only needs while shown
// (e.g. a custom clock face's decoded PSRAM sprites) and reclaim it for whichever
// app is coming to the front.

    //
    // These used to be numbers typed at each call site, and the numbers then dictated the
    // menu: the Intel screen had to be registered AFTER Settings, leaving Settings stranded
    // mid-list, because moving it would have turned selectApp(4) into the wrong screen on a
    // factory-reset boot. The running order of a menu should be a design decision, not a
    // consequence of which integers somebody already wrote down.
    //
    // Registration in main.cpp and sim_main.cpp follows this order, and every jump names a
    // slot. To move an app in the menu, move it here and move its add() call to match.
    // Settings stays last: it is the drawer everything else is not.
    //
    // APP_TICKER was missing from here for six weeks, and this is the second time this list
    // has gone out of step with the registration order. The Stock Ticker was added as a
    // seventh app in 1.58.0 and registered between News and Settings, but nobody added it
    // to this enum — so APP_SETTINGS stayed 5, which by then was the Ticker. Every
    // selectApp(APP_SETTINGS) in the tree quietly went to the wrong screen, including the
    // one at main.cpp's boot that is supposed to open WiFi setup on a device with no
    // network. The result was an Orb that came up after a factory reset showing the
    // Ticker's background plate with no quotes on it, no WiFi prompt anywhere, and a knob
    // captured by a screen nobody could see. Its owner concluded his own product was
    // frozen. See CUT-03 / UX-022.
    //
    // The comment above already warned that moving an app "would have turned selectApp(4)
    // into the wrong screen on a factory-reset boot", and sim_main.cpp records the same
    // fault happening once before with APP_INTEL. Two warnings in prose, two occurrences.
    // So this is now checked at boot rather than trusted: see app_shell::verifySlots().
    // APPS_LAUNCH_ONE (config.h) takes Weather, Surveillance and the Ticker off the
    // roster for launch one. The slots go with them rather than being left as holes:
    // a slot naming an app nobody registers is the fault verifySlots() exists to catch,
    // and leaving three of them deliberately would make the check cry wolf for ever.
