// The Orb OS — build & user configuration.

// Bump this whenever a build goes out that a device could be BEHIND. That is not only
// releases: 1.4.2 sat still through the Intel screen being rebuilt, an app being deleted,
// another renamed, and a serial command being added, so Studio compared "1.4.2" against
// "1.4.2", said "up to date", and left an Orb missing everything in that list. THEME_CAPS
// exists because this stopped moving; it covers theme settings and nothing else, so a new
// command or a deleted screen is invisible to it. Move this too.
#define FW_VERSION "2.16.36"   // shown on the web config page + Stats screen
// Edit pins below: replace every -1 with the value from the Waveshare factory demo
// (see docs/HARDWARE.md and docs/SETUP.md). Do NOT guess them.

// ---------- Which apps this build ships (CUT-01) ----------
// Launch one is exactly Clock, Flight tracker, News and Settings. Weather, Surveillance
// and the Stock Ticker come off the roster.
//
// ABSENT, not present and disabled, and the distinction is UX-042's: every app that ships
// is on every unit, so an app that is not ready is not shipped rather than shipped dark.
// A theme can already hide an app it does not want (theme.json's roster, and the `hidden`
// flag app_shell::add takes); that is a design's choice about a finished app, which is a
// different thing from a product not carrying one yet.
//
// One switch rather than deleted code, because the cut list is explicit that these three
// are "real, wanted, and waiting" and that nothing there is cancelled. Setting this to 0
// brings all three back exactly as they were.
//
// This is uniform across every unit, which is what keeps it inside UX-042: the requirement
// forbids holding a feature back from SOME buyers, not shipping a product that does not
// have it yet.
//
// The firmware still PARSES weather_style.json and ticker_style.json, and Apps/Names keep
// their fields, because TC-008 says a shipped parameter is never removed. THEME_CAPS stays
// at 34 for the same reason; Studio hides the controls behind its own flag rather than the
// device pretending it never understood them.
#define APPS_LAUNCH_ONE 1

// ---------- Home location ----------
// A PLACEHOLDER, and deliberately not a place. The device has exactly two location inputs
// (UX-025): the network it joins, looked up at the end of WiFi setup and retried on any
// later boot that finds none set, and a location the owner picks in Settings, which always
// wins. Neither is compiled in.
//
// This was Phoenix, the owner's own city, and before it a pushed design's coordinates could
// override even that. Either way a stranger whose lookup had not run yet was shown somebody
// else's sky with nothing on the dial saying so. Now `locSet` in NVS records whether a real
// location has ever been established, the Flight Tracker says "Location not set" until one
// has, and the aircraft feed is not polled at all — so these two numbers are never drawn
// and never queried. They exist so the projection maths has a valid double to hold.
//
// The simulator keeps its own centre (SIM_HOME_LAT in sim_main.cpp, ORBLAT/ORBLON to move
// it), because there is no NVS on the desktop and nothing to look up an IP against.

// the display shows off-range traffic as edge arrows. The floor MUST stay small: the old 50 km
// floor made small display ranges still pull a huge aircraft list in busy airspace, which timed
// out the poll (feed permanently amber near big hubs). Fix contributed by @alexzogh (STLWarehouse).

// taken because the feed kept answering with 403/429.
//
// The last step is the counter-intuitive one and it is worth writing down: polling LESS
// delivers MORE. Measured over a 10-minute soak at 5 s, the feed refused four times, and
// each refusal costs a 60 s backoff by design (see the refusal branch in main.cpp). That is
// roughly four of the ten minutes spent deliberately silent, in bursts, so the dial went
// stale for a minute at a time. At 10 s the request rate halves to about 360/hour, which
// should stay under whatever window is being tripped, and steady updates every 10 s beat
// bursts of updates every 5 s separated by minute-long penalties.

// full-brightness traffic, because the banner fired at 45 s and the first dimming at 60.
// The instrument contradicted itself. The fix was one clock for both.
//
// One clock is stricter than the fault required, though. A banner appearing BEFORE anything
// looks stale is the contradiction; aircraft fading before the banner arrives is a graduated

// ---------- ADS-B API (free, non-commercial) ----------
// Plain HTTP on purpose, and it is what makes the radar work at all.
//
// A TLS handshake needs two contiguous ~16 KB buffers from internal RAM, and this board
// cannot offer them: the largest free internal block is ~17 KB no matter what else is
// freed. That was measured, not assumed. Routing every LVGL allocation to PSRAM changed
// the number by exactly zero bytes, because it is a property of the memory map rather than
// fragmentation anyone can tidy up. So every HTTPS fetch died with '-32512 SSL memory
// allocation failed', which left the radar with no aircraft, the weather blank, and the
// device rebooting itself every ~27 minutes on the stuck-feed watchdog.
//
// Dropping to HTTP costs almost nothing here, because ADSB_HTTPS_INSECURE was already 1:
// certificates were never verified, so TLS was only hiding public flight data from
// eavesdroppers, never authenticating the source. No credentials are sent. adsb.lol serves
// this endpoint over HTTP.
//
// There is no fallback host. The airplanes.live entry that used to sit here was never
// referenced by any code, and as of 2026-08-23 that service answers 403 to every request
// with a note demanding you email them for permission first, so it was a fallback in name
// only. The nearest free replacement, opendata.adsb.fi, redirects HTTP to HTTPS and so is
// unreachable from this device at all (see the TLS note above). Until a gateway exists to
// hold real failover off-device, this feed is genuinely single-sourced, and adsb.lol's
// slow spells (a 32.2 s TCP connect measured 2026-08-22) are felt directly by the scope.
#define ADSB_PRIMARY_HOST   "api.adsb.lol"          // GET /v2/point/{lat}/{lon}/{radius_nm}
// What that host is called ON SCREEN, kept next to the host so the two cannot drift. UX-039
// wants a failure to name the source that could not be reached, and the full hostname is too
// long for a banner in a 466 px circle — this is the short form a person can act on.

// Not a cosmetic string. A User-Agent is how an API operator sees who is calling and where
// to complain, and this one named the upstream project and linked to its author's

// would have been counted against his project, and anyone at adsb.lol wanting to reach the
// maintainer would have reached the wrong person.

// The Orb's name on the local network. ONE definition, because this was nine separately

// Renamed from `capsuleradar` in 1.40. Deliberately NOT kept as a second name: ESPmDNS
// registers one hostname, and the IDF call that could add another is for advertising OTHER

// next DHCP renewal. An address that confidently resolves to the wrong place is worse than

// behind api.adsb.lol answered a laptop on Zion's own network as open, open, dead one
// minute and timeout, timeout, 200-in-355ms ten minutes later. The service is not down, it
// FLAPS, and which door opens changes by the minute. Roughly one attempt in six succeeded.

// Patience, because the measurements demand it. During one of this provider's slow spells
// a plain TCP connect to api.adsb.lol took 32.2 SECONDS from a laptop on the same network,

// third of one; the fifteen was there to be patient with a slow server, and what it actually
