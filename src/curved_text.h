// RGB565+alpha raster.
//
// This is the THIRD screen to want it and the first to not copy it. clock_view.cpp grew the
// original (draw_baked_arc_text/blit_glyph_rot), radar_view.cpp copied it wholesale for the
// selection banners — its own comment says so — and the Headlines screen asking for the
// same thing is what finally made the duplication worth paying off rather than repeating.
// LVGL has no curved-text primitive and no glyph rotation, so somebody has to do this by
// hand; it should be somebody once.
//
// The only thing that had to change to share it is that the destination is now a parameter
// rather than a file-scope canvas: both original copies read a static buffer and the screen
// constants directly, which is exactly what made them uncopyable without editing.

// The same glyph machinery without the arc: text on straight baselines, laid out by each
// glyph's own advance width so a digit changing width pushes only the tail of the string and
// a live value never wobbles.
//
// `str` MAY contain newlines, and this is the only place that gets to know how to lay them.
// It knows because the alternative was proven on the glass: this used to lay exactly one
// line, and LVGL reports '\n' as a glyph of zero width, so a caller handing over three lines
// got all three welded into one run-on that overflowed the dial in both directions. One
// caller (splash_lines' credits) walked the newline by hand and was fine; the next one (the
// config address) did not know it had to, and shipped broken. Rule six: the shared path
// enforces it, because a note beside one call site protects one call site.
//
// A block is CENTRED on `by` rather than hung below it, so a one-line string lands exactly
// where it always did and a three-line one grows both ways. That is the same expression
// menu_text::draw_wrapped derives and the same one Orb Studio lays its preview with, so a
// design does not move between the browser and the dial.
//
// align: 0 = bx is the start, 1 = bx is the middle, 2 = bx is the end.
// pill: optional plate behind the words, drawn first. Opa 0, the default, draws none. One
//   plate per line, each sized to its own line: a single box around a ragged block is a
//   different shape from the one any design was drawn against.
// lineGap: extra pixels between lines, on top of the font's own line height. 0 is what an
//   LVGL label does by default and what the config address needs to sit where it used to.
//   Note that splash_lines' data credits do NOT come through here: Orb Studio previews them
//   as two separately anchored lines, so they stay two calls. See the comment there.
