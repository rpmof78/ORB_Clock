// What the knob does, in one place, shared by the device (main.cpp) and the simulator
// (sim_main.cpp) so "it behaved right in the sim" means "it behaves right on the Orb".
//
// THE ROCK
//
// Turning used to open the app switcher. That made the knob useless for anything else:
// every app that wanted a turn of its own had to first be given the knob by a button press,
// and this button takes real force to click. So the knob had one job and the button had all
// the others, which is backwards for a device whose only control is a knob.
//
// Now a turn belongs to whatever app is on screen, and the switcher is opened by ROCKING the
// knob: a quick turn one way immediately followed by a quick turn back. Ordinary use never
// looks like that. Scrolling a list back and forth does, but slowly, and it is the speed that
// separates the gesture from someone changing their mind, which is why the window is tight.
//
// EITHER direction fires. Left-then-right only was the rule until 2026-08-29, on the reasoning
// that one fixed order halves the accidental reversals for no cost in performing it. There was
// a cost: a hand reaching for the menu does not decide which way to go first, so half the
// attempts did nothing. See knob.cpp for what carries the margin now, and UX-011.
//
// There is no fallback way in, by choice. If this proves unreliable on real hardware the
// window is the thing to tune, and if it cannot be made reliable then a fallback should come
// back rather than the tuning being fudged.
namespace {

// How long after a leftward detent a rightward one still counts as the same gesture. Short
// enough that a deliberate reversal has to be quick; long enough to be performable. Tuned
// on hardware, not derived — if this needs to move, this is the number.
// Measured, not guessed. 320 was a guess and it was wrong by half.
//
// Nine rocks captured off the real knob on 2026-08-26, gap between the last left detent and
// the first right one:
//
//     96, 150, 624, 624, 625, 654, 655, 644, 625 ms
//
// The two fast ones are what a deliberate, already-failed-once attempt looks like. The
// natural motion is the cluster at 620-660, every one of which the old 320 window threw
// away, which is exactly the reported "works sometimes". 800 clears the cluster with about
// 20% of headroom and is still far short of anything a person would call a pause.
//
// The cost of being generous is small and bounded: while the switcher is up this check is
// skipped entirely, so a false positive can only happen INSIDE an app, and of the apps that
// read a turn at all the worst outcome is that scrolling Intel back and forth opens the
// menu. If that ever becomes the complaint, this number is the dial, and the measurement is
// still in the firmware to re-run it.
//
// 800 was not enough either, and the reason is worth writing down because it will happen
// again to whoever measures this next. The 620-660 cluster was captured while the gesture
// was FAILING, and a person whose rock has just been ignored rocks the next one harder and
// faster. Measured again once it worked, on an unrelated errand, the same hand produced:
//
//     1096, 95, 1045, 5196 ms
//
// A natural rock is around a second; the fast ones are retries. Measuring a gesture at the
// moment it is broken measures the frustration, not the gesture. 1400 covers the natural
// motion and still rejects the 5196, which was a change of mind rather than a rock.
//
// This is also what "it works on Aviator but not on Steam Punk" turned out to be. Nothing
// in this path knows what theme is loaded: the detection is in the knob ISR and the
// dispatch is here. The rocks on that day were simply slower than the window.
// Back to 800 alongside the run-length rule in knob.cpp, which is the change that actually
// mattered. Widening this to 1400 without it made ordinary browsing open the menu, because
// any left-then-right counted however far the left half had run. The two together are the
// gesture: a SHORT turn back, then forward, reasonably promptly.
// knob.cpp decides the quickness now (ROCK_QUICK_MS, 250 ms); this window only has to be
// no tighter than that, and it is the same number so the two cannot disagree.

// menu opens; more than that and it was a scroll that changed direction, so the held
// detents go to the app as if nothing had happened. Zion, browsing headlines: "it's very
