// The Intel screen: a title, a handful of headlines, and how old they are.
//
// The whole design rule here is that this is read from across a room, in passing. It is
// not a news reader and, at the default type size, there is nothing to scroll. Three
// headlines is the default because three fit on a 466 px circle at a size that can be
// read standing up; five is available for people who would rather have density than size.
//
// THEME_CAPS 11 made the screen composed rather than fixed: the title is its own movable
// text, the headline type size is the theme's to pick from the compiled set, the block
// has real margins, and the age line is placeable. A size big enough that the requested
// count no longer fits does not clip it: the view shows what fits and the knob scrolls,
// using the Flight Tracker's exact grammar — press to take the knob, turn to move,
// press again (or six idle seconds) to give it back.
namespace {

// A circle is a hostile place for text. At the vertical centre the dial is 466 px wide,
// but a line sitting 150 px above the middle only has about 350 px of glass under it, and
// text that overruns is clipped by the bezel rather than wrapped.
//
// Square mode (the original, and still the default) lays out every headline inside one
// fixed-width box, [marginLeft, 466 - marginRight] — the default margins reproduce the
// original 330 px column exactly. Curved mode (THEME_CAPS 10) intersects that box with
// the chord of theme_style::intel().curveRadius at each row's height, so a row near the
// middle keeps the box and a row near the top or bottom narrows to match the glass
// actually under it.

// as a colon someone had left on the end of the sentence — an indicator that sits inside
// the text's own line box stops being an indicator and becomes punctuation. Moving it to a
// row along the bottom fixed that but left it always-on, a permanent mark on a screen
// whose whole job is to be glanceable, so it was hidden except while scrolling; which then
// meant a resting screen said nothing at all about the story it was not showing.
//
// A chevron solves all three. It reads as "continues" rather than as a character, it is
// one mark rather than a row of them, and it carries DIRECTION, so the same element that
// says "there is more below" at rest says "you can go back up" once you are moving. Nothing
