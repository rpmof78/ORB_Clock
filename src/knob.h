    // of whether poll() has run — safe to read anytime, including from inside code that
    // blocks the main loop (e.g. Spy Cam's SD bulk load), to detect a turn that happened

    // Detected HERE rather than by comparing two timestamps in the caller, and the reason is
    // worth keeping. Two per-direction timestamps cannot answer "which came first" when both
    // land inside the same millisecond, which they routinely do — detents are stamped in
    // poll(), and consecutive polls can share a tick. Comparing them made left-then-right and
    // right-then-left identical, so the gesture fired on any fast reversal. Order is a
    // property of the sequence, so it has to be recorded as the sequence happens.

    // motion to zero before anything sees it.
