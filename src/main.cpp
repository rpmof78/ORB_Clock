// TRY a network without committing to it. The credentials are a candidate until the Orb has
// actually associated; host_wifi_commit_credentials() below is what makes them permanent.
//
// WiFi.persistent() is the whole fix. Its default on this core is TRUE, so WiFi.begin()
// writes the SSID and password into the driver's own NVS (nvs.net80211) AT THE CALL, before
// a single packet is exchanged — on intent, with no fact behind it. Pressing OK on a
// neighbour's network with a wrong password therefore destroyed the working network the
// owner already had, and a power cycle brought the Orb back asking to be set up again. That
// is UX-021: setup, once completed, stays completed, and a mistyped password is a weaker
// event than the power loss and firmware updates that requirement already survives.
//
// This is the SECOND time this exact fault has shipped. main.cpp's own comment dated
// 2026-08-15 records the first: a secrets.h fallback called WiFi.begin() at boot, "it
// overwrote the user's real saved network on EVERY boot... the device came up in the config
// portal with its good credentials already gone." That call site was fixed and the lesson
// written down. This one reintroduced it from Settings, because the lesson lived in a
// comment beside the old caller rather than in the function every caller goes through.
// Copy whatever network is currently stored into OUR namespace, before anything is allowed
// to disturb it. Restored by host_wifi_restore_credentials() if the attempt fails.
//
// This exists because the previous fix did not work and cost its owner a second setup. That
// one set WiFi.persistent(false) before WiFi.begin(), on the understanding that begin()
// would then leave the stored config alone. Whatever the driver actually does, it is not
// that: a failed attempt against a neighbour's network still destroyed a working one.
//
// So this does not reason about the driver at all. capsuleradar is our namespace and nothing
// in the WiFi stack touches it, so a copy kept there survives whatever begin() decides to do
// to nvs.net80211. The password is written alongside the SSID; it already lives in plain
// form in the driver's own namespace on the same flash, so this moves no secret anywhere it
