// A command channel over the USB serial port, so a browser can talk to the Orb.
//
// Why this exists: a public website cannot reach a device on someone's home WiFi, and
// should not be able to. WebSerial is the one path that works, and it works because the
// owner physically plugs the cable in and grants permission per device. That makes the
// USB port, not the network, the front door for Studio.
//
// Two constraints shape the protocol:
//
// 1. This port is already a debug console. Firmware prints freely to Serial, and that
//    output interleaves with anything we send. So every reply is framed with a sentinel
//    prefix (RESP_TAG) and terminated by a newline: the browser scans lines, ignores
//    everything that is not tagged, and never has to guess whether a line is log spam or
//    an answer. Requests are tagged too (REQ_TAG), which keeps a human poking at the
//    console from tripping a theme switch by typing a bare word.
//
// 2. Commands are plain space-separated words, not JSON. Replies are JSON because the
//    browser wants structure, but parsing JSON on the device would mean linking a parser
//    for the sake of three verbs. Emitting is cheap; consuming is not.
//
// Reads are non-blocking and bounded. poll() drains only what is already buffered and
// returns, because it runs in the same loop() that services the knob, and input latency
// is the thing this project keeps having to defend.

#include <stddef.h>
