#define SWEEP_PERIOD_MS   8000
// Sweep redraw cadence. Every tick invalidates the sweep's rotated bounding box, and
// LVGL must then re-blend every layer intersecting it — with this theme that is seven
// layers, two of them full-screen with alpha. Measured on device: ~250 ms of compositing
// per frame, i.e. ~4 fps, while this timer was asking for a redraw every 30 ms. Asking
// eight times faster than the hardware can deliver does not make it faster, it just
// queues more invalidation work behind an already-late frame.
//
// Now that the sweep advances by REAL elapsed time (see sweep_timer_cb), a slower tick
// does not slow the rotation down — it just takes bigger angular steps per redraw. So
// this is chosen to be achievable rather than aspirational.
// Ask for frames at a rate the hardware can actually meet. This theme composites for
// ~166 ms per frame (measured: 6 fps, 88% of every second inside LVGL), and this timer was
// asking every 66 ms, two and a half times faster. The surplus requests do not produce
// surplus frames; they just land whenever the renderer gets to them, so the gaps between
// redraws are irregular. Since the sweep advances by real elapsed time, irregular gaps
// become irregular angular steps, which is the jitter Zion could see.
//
// Slower and regular beats faster and ragged here: a steady sweep is what makes this read
// as an instrument, and that was Zion's explicit priority over everything else on screen.
// Paced to what this device can ACTUALLY render, not to what looks good on paper.
//
// This was 66 ms (15 fps requested). Measured on hardware, a Flight Tracker frame takes
// 66-160 ms, averaging 81: the minimum is exactly this timer period, and everything above
// it is the renderer failing to keep up. So the timer was asking for frames faster than
// they could be drawn, and the overshoot landed as uneven arrival — 66 ms then 160 ms then
// 70 — which is precisely the stutter the eye picks up. A frame rate you cannot hit is not
// a frame rate, it is a source of jitter.
//
// Zion's priority is explicit and this follows it: perfectly even motion beats a higher
// number. At 100 ms the timer, not the renderer, decides when frames happen almost all of
// the time, so they arrive evenly. Costs ~2 fps and buys consistency.
// Measured, not guessed. Three values tried on the hardware, steady-state frame-time
// spread (the thing the eye actually reads as stutter):
//     66 ms  -> avg 81 ms,  spread 94-99 ms    (the old value: asking for frames it cannot draw)
//    100 ms  -> avg 103 ms, spread 55-60 ms    <- best
//    120 ms  -> avg 123 ms, spread 122-157 ms  (worse: heavy frames land as bigger multiples)

// How often aircraft glyphs are allowed to move. Deliberately coarse, and it is a product
// decision rather than a performance accident: a steady sweep is what makes this read as an
// instrument, while an aircraft's position being two seconds stale is invisible. Zion chose
// that trade explicitly.
//
// Each step invalidates one box per aircraft that moved, and with ~28 contacts on screen
// every one of those boxes forces LVGL to re-blend all the layers it touches. That was the
// variable cost per frame, and variable cost is exactly what the sweep cannot tolerate:
// because the sweep advances by real elapsed time, an unusually slow frame makes it take an
// unusually big angular jump. Correct speed, uneven motion. Measured before this change:
// 88% of every second inside LVGL, frame rate wandering 5-7 fps.
//
// Time-gated rather than counted in frames, so the cadence stays 2 s whatever the frame
// rate is doing. A frame counter would have made this drift with the very thing it is
// meant to stabilise.
// Matched to how far a glyph actually travels, which is the only thing that decides how
// many steps are worth taking. An aircraft crosses about 30 px of a 30 km scope between
// polls ten seconds apart, so 250 ms gives about forty steps for thirty pixels of travel:
// slightly more than one step per pixel, and anything faster is work that cannot change a
// single pixel on the glass.
//
// It was 2000, which is five steps across a whole poll, and that was chosen to protect a
// frame budget. The A/B above says the budget was never at risk: 80 ms and 2000 ms both

// The SAME sweep, on another tile. See the header for why this is not a second one.
//
// The scope is tile 0 of a tileview and the weather map is tile 1, so the sweep built here
// simply is not on the weather tile: it had no sweep at all. Moving the object costs a
// re-parent and nothing else, because the timer that turns it is created once in init() and
// never paused, and it advances by real elapsed time rather than by ticks. It therefore
// keeps turning at the same rate through the move, and arrives at the right angle rather
// than starting again from zero.
//
// Ordering: foreground within its new parent, so it sits over the precipitation image the
// way it sits over the scope's rings. Callers that put anything above it re-assert that
// afterwards, the same as everywhere else on this device.
// Build the weather map its OWN sweep, on its own tile, from its own settings.
//
// This started out as "move the scope's sweep across", which worked and was wrong: the
// weather map then wore the Flight Tracker's brass, because it was literally the Flight
// Tracker's object. They are separate apps that happen to be built the same way.
//
// What is shared is the timer and s_sweepDeg, which is the only part smoothness ever
// depended on. Nothing else crosses between them: not the colour, not the artwork, not the
// speed, not the on/off switch.
