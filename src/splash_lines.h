// The three standing lines on the splash / About screen, and the glass over them.
//
// Why this is a module and not two copies: the splash and the About page are the same
// picture in two places, and before this they diverged. The boot splash was the picture
// alone; About was the picture plus three labels nailed to hardcoded offsets in
// settings_view.cpp. Making those three themeable in one of the two would have finished the
// job in half the places it exists.
//
// What it draws, in order, over whatever the parent already shows:
//
//   1. the firmware version, the config address, and the data credits, into one canvas
//   2. splash_overlay.png, the glass and CRT, on top of all of it
//
// The glass is last and is not negotiable. It is the top layer of every screen on this
// device, and a screen that puts anything above it looks like a mistake because it is one.
// The splash used to get this by having the glass painted into splash.png in the browser,
// which worked only for as long as the firmware drew nothing afterwards.
//
// The three lines are drawn for EVERY theme: their compiled defaults are the offsets
// settings_view.cpp used to hardcode, so nothing already on a card loses them. Only the
// GLASS is conditional, on theme_style::Splash::styled, because an older theme's splash.png
// has it painted in already and compositing it again would show it twice.
