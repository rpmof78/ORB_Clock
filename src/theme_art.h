// Pre-baked theme art, resident in flash and drawn without any runtime work.
//
// The problem this solves, measured on a 466x466 plate (see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md):
//     read 342 KB PNG off the SD card   226 ms   (card is 20 MHz SPI, ~1.5 MB/s)
//     unpack the PNG to RGB565          205 ms
//                                       -------
//                                       431 ms, every single time the screen is shown,
//                                       plus 424 KB of PSRAM held while it is up.
//
// Both halves are avoidable. A PNG is a compressed picture; the panel wants raw RGB565.
// Nothing in the pipeline ever did that conversion ahead of time, so the device did it
// over and over. Launch Kit now bakes the exact bytes the panel wants at push time (on a
// Mac, where the work is free) and the device stores them in the `themeart` flash
// partition. The ESP32-S3 memory-maps flash through its cache, so an asset in there is
// just a pointer: no SD read, no decode, no PSRAM copy, no per-show cost at all.
//
// Deliberately NOT a replacement for the SD/PNG path. An asset that was never baked, or
// a theme installed before this existed, falls through to decode_sd_first() unchanged.
// Flash is a cache in front of that path, never a precondition for it.
