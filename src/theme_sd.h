// Shared "read a whole theme-art file into PSRAM" helper for every screen
// that can source its art from the SD card instead of a flash-baked PNG
// array (splash_art.cpp, custom_sprite.cpp, radar/menu/settings_sprite.cpp).
// Portable the same way roads_sd.cpp is: real SD.open() on the device, a
// local stand-in directory (sim/sdcard, same root roads_sd::set_root()
// points the desktop simulator at) when built for the native/desktop target
// — so "Preview in simulator" exercises this exact code path too.
//
// One fixed path per asset for now (e.g. "/theme/clock_plate.png"), not yet
// per-theme-slug folders — see the comment above SD_SPLASH_PATH in
// splash_art.cpp for why (there's no on-device theme *selection* yet to
// route to a slug). Read failures of any kind (no card, missing file, over
// the size ceiling, short read) return nullptr — every caller already has a
// flash-baked/stock fallback, so this never needs to be fatal.
namespace theme_sd {

// Returns a freshly-allocated PSRAM (device) / heap (sim) buffer, or nullptr
// on any failure. Caller must pass the result to free() when done with it —
// this only ever holds the raw compressed bytes briefly, for a decode call,
// never the decoded pixels.

// The card is not thread safe and, until the chime started streaming, never needed to be:
// every reader on this device ran on the main task, which made SD single-threaded by
// convention rather than by construction. Streaming a chime broke that convention, so the two
// big readers take this around their file work. It is a lock over the CONVENTION, not over the
// whole driver: the rarer readers (roads, spycam, the link's transfers) still rely on running
// where they always have.
