// (device: ESP.restart(); sim: an actual re-exec via setRestartHook, not a live
// in-place repaint) so no screen ever runs a mix of the old and new theme's
// decoded art. This mirrors app_theme almost exactly, just for a dynamic list of
// string slugs (whichever /themes/<slug>/ folders actually exist on the card)
// instead of a fixed two-entry enum.
