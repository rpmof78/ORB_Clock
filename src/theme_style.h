#pragma once
// Per-theme visual style (colors/positions/formats/geometry) — the runtime half of
// the multi-theme SD system. Art (plate/overlay/hand/blip PNGs) already travels per
// theme via /themes/<slug>/*.png (see theme_sd.h + each screen's own decode_sd_first
// pattern). Until this module existed, STYLE (everything a Launch Kit push bakes as a
// CUSTOM_* #define into custom_clock.h/custom_radar.h/custom_settings.h/custom_menu.h)
// was compile-time only — one shared firmware binary, so switching the active SD theme
// via Settings > Design swapped the art but not the color/format/layout, which stayed
// stuck on whichever theme's screen was pushed last (see git history/PRs referencing
// "theme bleeding"). This reads a small per-theme JSON file alongside the art
// (/themes/<slug>/{clock,radar,settings,menu}_style.json, written by Launch Kit on
// every push — see server.js's writeSimSdAsset("*_style.json", ...) call sites) and
// overrides the compiled CUSTOM_* defaults with it, per field, per theme.
//
// NOT covered (known, deliberate limitations — same class of "compile-time only" gap
// that already existed for these before this module, unchanged by it):
//   - Fonts (CUSTOM_*_FONT) — real compiled LVGL glyph bitmaps, not simple values;
//     making these travel per-theme needs LVGL's binary font/lv_fs runtime-loading
//     path, a separate, much larger undertaking. Whichever theme's screen was pushed
//     last still wins the font family/size/weight.
//
// FIXED since this comment was written (these now DO travel per theme):
//   - Clock hand art, pivot, center, blend, draw order, and the per-hand show/hide
//     gates. Art comes from /themes/<slug>/clock_hand_{hour,minute,second}.png and
//     clock_static{1,2}.png; geometry from the "hands" block in clock_style.json.
//   - Which apps appear in the knob menu, from /themes/<slug>/theme.json.
//   - Radar sweep/blip rotation pivots, and the radar layer order.
//   - Radar's operational params: range, max aircraft, hide-ground, min-altitude and
//     the centre dead zone all travel in radar_style.json now. The compile-time
//     CUSTOM_HAS_RADAR_{RANGE,MAXAC,HIDEGROUND,MINALT,DEADZONE} overrides that used to
//     sit alongside them in main.cpp are gone, not merely outranked: two of them
//     (hide-ground, min-altitude) ran AFTER applyThemeSettings() and silently undid a
//     theme that had stated both, which is the failure this whole module exists to stop.
//   - Home lat/lon deliberately does NOT travel. It is the owner's, not the theme's: a
//     design that moved somebody's Orb to the designer's city on install would be the
//     device reconfiguring itself over a choice its owner had already made. It comes
//     from Settings, the setup page, or GPS, and nothing on the card can outrank that.
//     CUSTOM_HAS_RADAR_HOME, which pinned every unit flashed from one push to that
//     push's coordinates and quietly made the setup page's lat/lon box a no-op, is
//     deleted rather than migrated.
//   - Most of the remaining CUSTOM_HAS_* show/hide gates have been demoted to seeding a
//     runtime default: the SD art path runs whatever the macro says, and the draw sites
//     test a `show` field this module fills in. What is still a real compile-time gate,
//     and therefore still decided by whichever theme was pushed last, is the four master
//     switches (CUSTOM_HAS_MENU, CUSTOM_HAS_SETTINGS, CUSTOM_HAS_RADAR,
//     CUSTOM_HAS_RADAR_STYLE) and the menu's three per-slot gates. Those are the next
//     migration, not a standing limitation.
#include <lvgl.h>

namespace theme_style {

// What this firmware understands of a theme, as one number a designer's tool can ask for.
//
// The version string is no use for this. FW_VERSION tracks releases and sat at 1.3.24
// across several new theme settings, so a design tool comparing versions would have said
// "up to date" about an Orb that silently dropped half of what it was sent. That is not a
// hypothetical: it cost an afternoon chasing a sweep hand that would not move behind the
// aircraft, on an Orb whose firmware simply had no idea the setting existed.
//
// So: bump this by one whenever the firmware learns to read a NEW theme setting, and add a
// line to the ledger. Never renumber, never reuse. Orb Studio keeps the matching table of
// which setting needs which level, and refuses to install a design the Orb would not
// honour rather than letting it look installed.
//
// Firmware older than this constant reports no caps field at all, which a tool should read
// as level 0: assume nothing, verify nothing.
//
//   1  radar layer order, keep-out areas, synthesised test traffic, and sweep/aircraft
//      rotation pivots as theme data
//   2  the menu's per-slot show flag: a design can drop the previous/next hints and keep
//      only the centred app name
//   3  the clock's two live text banners (text1/text2), drawn from the theme's own show
//      flag instead of whichever CUSTOM_HAS_TEXT{1,2} a past firmware push happened to
//      compile in
//   4  hand shadows cast by a FIXED light: a separate pre-blurred silhouette sprite per
//      hand, drawn at the same angle as the hand but offset in SCREEN space, so the shadow
//      falls the same way whatever hour it is. A theme baking its shadow into the hand
//      sprite instead needs nothing from the firmware and still works below this.
//   5  the flight tracker's own furniture, all of it added in one sitting and all of it
//      invisible to an Orb below this level:
//        - the selection card (radar_card.png plus the `card` block) and the readout lines'
//          runtime show/onCard flags. A line laid out for the card reads its across/down as
//          offsets from the card's centre, so on older firmware it does not merely lose the
//          card, it stacks near the middle of the dial with nothing behind it.
//        - the sweep's own trail geometry: sweepTrailWidth / sweepLeadWidth /
//          sweepTrailSteps, which were 5 / 2 / 20 welded into sweep_draw_cb.
//        - the map's colours: mapRoadsOn / mapRoadColor / mapRoadOpacity / mapAirportsOn /
//          mapAirportColor, previously a fixed grey drawn whether or not it was wanted.
//        - rangeKm: how far the rim is. Launch Kit could set this only by recompiling
//          (CUSTOM_RADAR_RANGE_KM), so a files-only theme had no way to state it at all.
//   6  the rings and crosshair as their OWN etched plate (radar_rings.png), drawn above
//      the map instead of baked into the background beneath it. Scope furniture could not
//      stay readable over busy roads while it lived under them. An Orb below this level
//      finds no such asset and draws a background with no rings on it at all, which is
//      why `ringsPlate` below exists to be refused rather than silently dropped.
//   7  mapRoadWidth: how heavy the roads are drawn. roads_sd::draw has always taken a
//      width and every call site passed a literal 1, so a theme could pick the roads'
//      colour and opacity but never their weight. An Orb below this draws hairlines.
//   8  the sweep's own hub: a disc at the pivot the hand turns about, with its own colour,
//      size and glow. The sweep drew lines out of a bare centre and the only thing ever at
//      the middle of the dial was the aircraft layer's centre mark, which belongs to the
//      aircraft and travels with them through the stack.
//   9  the Headlines screen as theme data: background colour, the four text colours, how
//      many headlines (1..5), and which topic/source the gateway is asked for. All of it
//      was a fixed black screen with four hardcoded colours and always exactly three
//      general-topic BBC headlines below this level, because intel_view.cpp had never
//      once read anything from a theme.
//  10  the Headlines screen's text boundary: square (the original fixed-width wrap) or
//      curved, where each row's wrap width is the chord of a circle at that row's height
//      instead of one constant. curveRadius picks which circle: small numbers pull the
//      margins in hard near the top and bottom rows, large numbers approach the same
//      straight-sided wrap square mode has always used. An Orb below this level has no
//      concept of a curved boundary at all and wraps every theme at the original fixed
//      width, which is exactly square mode's behaviour, so nothing regresses for it.
//  11  the Headlines screen as a composed screen rather than a fixed layout: the title is
//      its own text (any words, own size, own position, hideable), headlines can pick a
//      type size from the compiled set instead of the automatic 14/16, the text block has
//      real left/right margins, the poll interval is the theme's to choose, and the
//      "just now" age line is a placeable, hideable field like every other line of text
//      in Studio, with its own colour, type size and glow. A size that overflows the dial
//      scrolls: press enters scroll mode, turn steps through the headlines, press again
//      or six idle seconds releases — the same knob grammar the Flight Tracker's aircraft
//      selection already taught. An Orb below this level draws the fixed INTEL layout it
//      always has, whatever is set here.
//  12  the Headlines screen finished: the full compiled size ladder (12..48 rather than
//      the six sizes level 11 shipped with), a vertical offset that moves the whole
//      headline block without touching the title or the age line, and a headline that
//      does not fit its rows FADING OUT at the bottom instead of ending in an ellipsis.
//      The scroll indicator also stopped being a column of dots beside the text, where it
//      read as stray punctuation, and became a row along the bottom shown only while the
//      knob is actually scrolling. An Orb below this level cannot draw the larger faces at
//      all (they are compiled glyph bitmaps, not scalable outlines), which is why this is
//      a level rather than a graceful fallback.
//  13  the Headlines screen's typography: leading between a headline's own two lines
//      (lineGap), an overrun marked by fading the RIGHT END of the last line rather than
//      its underside, and the age line as a format string with a {t} token so a theme can
//      write "Last updated: 5 min ago" or "5 min ago, last checked" instead of the bare
//      phrase. The underside fade was the wrong shape for the job: it read as the second
//      line failing to render rather than as the sentence continuing.
//  14  the Headlines screen's own artwork: a background picture (intel_plate.png) and the
//      shared glass/CRT overlay (intel_overlay.png), decoded by intel_sprite.cpp with the
//      same flash-then-SD order every other screen uses. It was colour-only before this
//      because no decoder for it existed, and offering the picker in Studio anyway would
//      have installed a setting the device silently ignored. A theme that ships neither
//      file still gets the flat background colour, so nothing older changes.
//  15  the Headlines screen's typography and framing finished: its own typeface per text
//      slot (title, headline, source, age) shipped as theme fonts like every other screen
//      already had, an arc option for the age line, top and bottom margins for the
//      headline band, up to twenty headlines held rather than five, and an explicit
//      how-many-on-screen separate from how-many-fetched. An Orb below this draws the
//      compiled face, keeps the line straight, and holds five.
//  16  the splash became a real screen rather than a flat picture. Its three standing
//      lines, the firmware version, the config address and the data credits, moved out of
//      hardcoded offsets in settings_view.cpp and into splash_style.json, so a theme places
//      and styles them like any other text: position, size from the ladder, colour, glow,
//      alignment, and an arc. They have no show/hide, on purpose: Studio reads the version
//      off the device before it will write a design, and the map credit is required by
//      OpenStreetMap's ODbL rather than offered as a courtesy.
//      This level also moves the glass OUT of splash.png. The picture used to have the
//      overlay painted into it in the browser, which put the glass under anything the
//      firmware drew afterwards; it is now composited on top like every other screen's,
//      reusing clock_overlay.png rather than baking a second copy. An Orb below this level
//      keeps the compiled offsets, and a THEME above it that lands on an older Orb simply
//      does not find splash_style.json, so nothing draws twice.
//  17  the gap between a headline and its source credit. It was 2 px, hardcoded in three
//      places, and 2 px is a statement about a compact sans: a 24 px display serif puts the
//      descenders of g and y straight through the credit line beneath it. An Orb below this
//      level keeps the 2 px, which is what every theme built before this asked for anyway.
//  18  opacity on every piece of text a theme controls. It costs nothing to draw: both
//      glyph blitters already multiply each pixel by an opacity, and the value was pinned
//      at full, while LVGL labels alpha-blend for anti-aliasing whatever happens. Faint
//      type is a real design tool on a screen this bright, and there was no way to ask for
//      it. An Orb below this level draws every one of them at full strength.
//  19  the News screen's browsing marks and its briefing. Turning the knob now moves a
//      selection through the headlines instead of sliding the window, and pressing opens
//      the story's own summary from the feed. An Orb below this level scrolls the way it
//      always did and does nothing on a press, so the theme's selection colours and bar
//      would be settings with no screen to appear on.
//  20  how the News screen's headline block is set: which edge the headlines and their
//      source credits line up on, and what angle the whole block sits at. All three were
//      welded — centred, centred, and square to the screen — which is the right default on
//      a round dial and the wrong one the moment the background art has an edge in it:
//      type set against a drawn sheet of paper has to sit where the paper's own margin is
//      and lie at the paper's own angle. An Orb below this level centres both and draws
//      the block square, so a design set flush left on a tilted sheet would appear centred
//      and level on the device with nothing saying why. LVGL has left, centre and right
//      and no justify, so justify is not offered here rather than being offered and
//      silently centred.
//  21  a separate glow for the Settings wheel's selected row and for the rest. There was
//      one, applied to every row, so the one setting that could not mark which row is
//      selected was the one people reached for to do it. An Orb below this level reads only
//      the shared pair, which Studio still sends as the larger of the two, so an old device
//      shows one halo rather than none.
//  22  a second weight for the Settings wheel's selected row, shipped as its own converted
//      face (font_settings_sel.bin). Weight is baked into a font rather than something the
//      device can vary, so bold-when-selected is a second file or it is nothing. An Orb
//      below this level has no slot to load it into and draws every row in the one weight,
//      which is what the theme looked like before anybody asked for two.
//  23  the weather map as its own app, with weather_style.json: its own background, its
//      own sweep and its own colours. It had none of these and was borrowing the Flight
//      Tracker's sweep OBJECT outright, so it wore the Flight Tracker's artwork. An Orb
//      below this level ignores the file and draws the weather map as it always did, which
//      is with no sweep at all.
//  30  the weather map's data credit wearing the theme: where it sits, its colour, and the
//      pill behind it. UX-030 always allowed a credit to be restyled and only forbade
//      removing it; this was read as "leave it alone entirely", which left a white-on-black
//      chip sitting on top of designs that had composed everything else. There is no show
//      switch and text opacity has a floor, because "invisible" is how a removal would be
//      spelled if the field allowed it. An Orb below this level draws the credit exactly
//      where it always did, which is the same credit in a different place.
//  29  {age} and {ageMin} on the weather map: how old the picture currently on the glass
//      is, stepping with the animation rather than sitting on the weather data's slower
//      clock. Its own level rather than folded into 28 because 28 shipped without them for
//      a few minutes and an Orb flashed in that window would render the token as a gap,
//      which is exactly the silent nothing THEME_CAPS exists to turn into a refusal.
//  28  the weather map's own text and its own keep-out zones. Everything the map said was
//      fixed in ui.cpp: a temperature, a wind line, a range label, a centre label and a
//      title, each at a hard-coded position in a hard-coded colour, so a design could
//      restyle the map underneath them and not move one word on top of it. It now carries
//      four text slots of the same shape the Flight Tracker has, filled from a {token}
//      table (see wx_text_refresh in ui.cpp for the list), and its own zones, which restore
//      the theme's plate wherever the map is told not to draw. An Orb below this level
//      ignores both keys and draws the fixed labels exactly as it always did, which is also
//      what any Orb does when a theme defines no slots: absence means no opinion, not off.
//
//      Two things are deliberately NOT slots: the RainViewer credit, because a data source
//      credit is not a theme's to remove, and the status line, because the screen has to be
//      able to say a feed is loading or dead.
//  27  three things the weather map was offered in Orb Studio and never given, plus a
//      background picture for it and for the Stock Ticker. Its bg colour was never read at
//      all, so the map inherited whatever sat behind it and stayed black however a design
//      set it. Its sweepSpeed was never read either: both sweeps shared one angle, so the
//      slider moved the Flight Tracker's hand or nothing. And neither screen could carry a
//      plate. An Orb below this level keeps a black weather map at the Flight Tracker's
//      sweep speed and ignores both plates.
//  33  a text background behind any line of text on the device, not just the weather map's
//      data credit. Every text card in Orb Studio now asks the same question: sit on a
//      background, or curve to the dial. The credit was the only line that had ever been
//      offered a plate, which made it the odd one out on the one screen where somebody
//      would notice. bgOpa defaults to 0, so this changes nothing about how an existing
//      theme draws. An Orb below this level draws every line without its background.
//  32  the weather map's range rings gain the controls the Flight Tracker's have had all
//      along: how many, how thick, how strong, and a crosshair. An Orb below this level
//      draws the three fixed circles it always did.
//  31  the weather map's data credit can curve, on the same arc renderer every other text
//      element on the device uses. Only when the pill is off: a rounded rectangle is not a
//      shape that survives the line bending. An Orb below this level draws it straight.
//  26  the Stock Ticker: a watchlist the theme carries, a focused readout, and a strip
//      that can run along the bottom or bend around the bezel. An Orb below this level has
//      no such app and ignores ticker_style.json entirely.
//  25  the weather map's rings honoured at last: colour (behind its own switch, see
//      ringColorOn) and the on/off toggle. Both were in the theme and in Orb Studio, and
//      the firmware read neither: the rings were the built-in palette's accent, which is
//      the Flight Tracker's phosphor, on a screen that is supposed to be its own app. An
//      Orb below this level keeps drawing them in the accent and cannot switch them off.
//  24  a coastline on the weather map, and a road colour that is finally the theme's own.
//      The weather map drew roads at a hard-coded grey and had no coastline at all, so a
//      theme could set roadColor and roadsEnabled and watch neither do anything. An Orb
//      below this level draws no coastline and keeps the fixed grey.
//  34  the Flight Tracker's centre dead zone as theme data (deadZonePx), and the end of the
//      compile-time overrides that sat on top of the scope's other operational values. The
//      dead zone was the last of the six with no key at all: CUSTOM_RADAR_DEADZONE_PX only,
//      set by recompiling, with no device-side control either, so a files-only theme could
//      not ask for one and could not work around not having one.
//
//      The other half of this level is a removal, and it is the part worth reading. Range
//      and max-aircraft already had keys and already won, because their macros ran inside
//      loadSettings() before applyThemeSettings(). Hide-ground and min-altitude had keys
//      that were read, applied, and then unconditionally overwritten sixty lines later by
//      their macros — a theme could state both, have both parsed correctly off the card,
//      and fly neither. All five macros are gone now rather than reordered.
//
//      An Orb below this level ignores deadZonePx and draws no dead zone unless one was
//      welded into its firmware, which is exactly what every theme built before this got.
//  35  the theme's name and author as a fourth standing line on the splash (Splash.theme),
//      read from theme.json's "name" and "author". UX-028 has always listed both as what
//      that screen must carry, and CUT-07 says so by number; the splash carried the version
//      and the credits and neither of these. An Orb below this draws nothing where the line
//      sits, so Studio refuses every design to it, the way the glass clause at 16 does: the
//      preview shows a line the device would not.
//  36  the config address and the theme line can be switched off (SplashText.show, read for
//      those two only). Zion asked for it: the address is the Orb's own web page, which is
//      useful and not required, and on a splash designed as a picture it is clutter. The
//      version and the credits deliberately never read the flag, so a design cannot remove
//      what UX-028 and UX-030 say must be there. An Orb below this draws both lines whatever
//      the design says, so Studio refuses a design that turned one off.
//  37  a virtual mainspring on the clock (Clock.windOn/windHours/windSound/windNotice). The
//      clock runs down over a set number of hours, stops its hands, says so in words, and is
//      wound again with five turns of the knob. Zion asked for it after his vintage radio,
//      where the AM static between stations turned out to be the thing people talked about:
//      a small sensory detail that asks something of you is what makes an object feel alive.
//      An Orb below this level ignores all four keys and simply never runs down, which is a
//      theme quietly losing its character rather than drawing something wrong, so Studio
//      warns instead of refusing.
//  38  the same mainspring, with its duration in SECONDS (windSecs) rather than hours.
//      Level 37 shipped windHours and lived about an hour: Zion asked for a ten second and a
//      one minute setting, which no whole number of hours can say, and those two are what
//      make the feature testable at all rather than a two day wait per attempt. The level is
//      spent rather than the key quietly reused because an Orb on 37 reports a mainspring it
//      has and then cannot read the only field that says how long it runs, which is the tool
//      lying about what the device agreed to.
//  39  sounds a theme brings with it: wind.pcm for the winding click and chime.pcm for the
//      hour, raw PCM at the format audio.cpp already streams, converted in the browser where
//      there is a real audio stack rather than on a chip that has no business parsing an MP3.
//      Zion's, and from the same place the mainspring came from: the detail people talked
//      about on his vintage radio was a SOUND, and it belonged to that object rather than to
//      a settings menu. A Steam Punk clock and an Aviator chronometer have no more business
//      clicking alike than sharing a typeface. An Orb below this level uses its built-in tick
//      and its built-in chime, so Studio refuses a design that shipped either.
//  40  how many turns of the knob a full wind takes (Clock.windTurns). Five was a constant in
//      the firmware, and it is a FEEL rather than a fact: a pocket watch and a chronometer
//      should not ask for the same effort. The Orb builds the sentence on its own screen from
//      this number, so the words and the gesture cannot drift apart. An Orb below this level
//      always asks for five, whatever the design says.
//  41  the wind screen as a design rather than a fixed panel: its background, the colour and
//      weight of the gauge round the rim, and the words, size, colour and position of its
//      three lines. It shipped white on black in the built-in face because it was written
//      alongside the no-SD notice and inherited that screen's rules. It is not that kind of
//      screen: it appears during ordinary use on a themed clock, and a Steam Punk Orb asking
//      to be wound in a factory-looking grey sans is the seam showing. An Orb below this
//      level draws the fixed panel whatever the design says.
//  42  the wind screen's three lines get a TYPEFACE and margins: font_wind_{title,ask,turns}.bin
//      and a left/right band each, the same pair every other text element on the device has.
//      41 made the screen a design and left it in the built-in face, which is half a screen by
//      the standard docs/adding-a-screen.md sets, and the half that shows. An Orb below this
//      level draws the built-in face at the compiled sizes and wraps where it always did.
//  43  whether the clock's two text banners draw over the hands or under them
//      (Clock.textOverHands). Always under, until now. Orb Studio's layer column and its
//      preview both showed the opposite, so the one place a designer looks to answer "what is
//      on top" disagreed with the glass; that is fixed on the Studio side and this is the
//      control it was pretending to be. An Orb below this level draws the hands over the
//      words whatever the design says.
//  44  the wind screen gets a background picture, switches for its gauge and each of its
//      three lines, and a crank that turns with the knob (wind_bg.png, wind_crank.png). 41
//      made it a design and 42 gave it type; this is the rest of what a screen has. An Orb
//      below this level draws no picture and no crank, and shows the gauge and all three

//  49  the News screen's briefing gets a typeface and size of its own (font_intel_brief.bin,
//      Intel.briefSize) and a Back button at the foot of the band. It read in the source
//      credit's face at the credit's size, which is a caption size, and Zion could neither
//      see the story screen in Orb Studio nor change how it read. The Back button answers
//      the other thing he asked for: a press has always closed the story, and nothing on
//      the screen said so. Also at this level, though it needs no key: the bake now carries
//      every font slot, so the Headlines, Ticker, Weather and wind screens draw the theme's
//      typeface on the device for the first time (see theme_art_bake.cpp). An Orb below
//      this level reads the story in the credit's face, shows no Back button, and closes on
//      a press exactly as before. (49 shipped a briefBackOn switch for a day; 50 removed
//      it. Zion: "wouldn't you always want to have the back button?" Yes.)
//  50  the News screen's marks are placeable: the "more below" chevron under the headlines
//      (Intel.morePlace/moreX/moreY), the Back button on the story (backPlace/backX/backY)
//      and the story's own "more below" chevron (briefMorePlace/briefMoreX/briefMoreY),
//      each either worked out from the band as before or set to a screen coordinate. The
//      story also gained the chevrons the list already had: a long story scrolls, and
//      nothing said so. An Orb below this level places all three itself and draws no
//      chevrons on the story.
//  51  the story can hide the News screen's title while it is open (Intel.briefHideTitle),
//      so a design can show just the headline and the story. And, no key: the headline
//      band stops following the title and the updated line when those are moved. It was
//      worked out from wherever they sat, so dragging the updated line down to the bezel
//      pushed the headlines after it (Zion: "when I move the update line it screws the
//      newsfeed up"). The band now sits where the two lines sit BY DEFAULT unless the
//      design sets its own margins, which is the control that was always meant for that.
//      An Orb below this level keeps the title up over a story and still moves the band.
//  52  the Swiss railway stop on a sweeping second hand (Clock.secondRailway): round the
//      dial in 58.5 seconds, then a wait at 12 until the minute rolls. The station clocks of
//      the Swiss Federal Railways did this so one pulse a minute could pull every clock on
//      the network into step, and the Mondaine watch copies the pause because it is the
//      thing people remember about them.
//
//      WITHDRAWN on 2026-09-23 and PUT BACK on 2026-09-24, which is the part worth writing
//      down. The week it shipped, a separate fault put every theme's hands at twelve for a
//      frame (orb_time.h); three people read that as this feature leaking into their clocks,
//      and it was removed while the real cause was still unknown. It was innocent. Once that
//      was proved and fixed, WizardOfOz and Lerxtwood both asked for the stop back, and a
//      feature is not wrong because it was once suspected. Studio now explains what it is
//      where it is switched on, which is what was actually missing.
//
//      Only read while sweeping: a stop is a pause in a glide, and a ticking hand has no
//      glide to pause. An Orb below this level sweeps straight through.
//  53  ALL CAPS on any line of text a theme draws (`upper` on every text slot: the clock's
//      two banners, the Flight Tracker's and the Weather map's four each, the Ticker's, the
//      Spy Cam's, the app menu's three, and every line on the splash screen). Zion asked for
//      it on 2026-09-23 "in all of the text blocks for all apps", and named the case nobody
//      else could reach: the firmware version and the network address on the splash are
//      written by the device rather than typed by the designer, so a face that wanted small
//      caps throughout could not have them there at any price.
//
//      Applied to the FINISHED string at the moment of drawing rather than to the format,
//      which is the only place that catches live text: %A is Wednesday by the time strftime
//      is done with it, {callsign} is UAL328 by the time the expander is. ASCII only, since
//      the faces carry 0x20-0x7F and an accented letter has no uppercase form to draw.
//      Studio bakes the glyphs against the uppercased text, so the letters are there.
//      An Orb below this level draws every line in the case the design typed it.
//  54  the Flight Tracker's location line (Radar::locText): a text slot that names the place
//      the scope is centred on, {city} expanding to whatever the location was called when it
//      was set. Lerxtwood asked for it on 2026-09-25, having built it in his own fork, and
//      asked specifically that it be a layer a theme can switch rather than something the
//      firmware always draws. Off unless a design asks, per Zion.
//
//      No city database and no reverse geocoding. Every path that sets a location already
//      learns a name on its way past (the Settings search, a Studio setloc, the IP lookup),
//      and the name is now kept in NVS beside the coordinates, so this only has to read it
//      back. An Orb that has never been told what its position is called draws nothing here,
//      rather than a plate with nothing in it.
//
//      It is an ordinary TextSlot, so it has every control the other lines have, including
//      the pill, the arc and ALL CAPS. An Orb below this level ignores it entirely.
//
//  55  a moving background. The clock plate can carry extra frames, clock_plate_01.png
//      upwards, and the theme says how they play. Frame nought is the ordinary plate, so a
//      theme built this way still looks right on an Orb that has never heard of this: it
//      finds no extra frames, draws the plate it always drew, and nothing is missing.
//
//      Deliberately able to HOLD. A background that changes every frame throws away the
//      cache the sweeping second hand depends on (see clock_view.cpp), which costs about a
//      third of the hand's smoothness for as long as it runs. Holding on frame nought and
