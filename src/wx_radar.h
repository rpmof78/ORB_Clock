// channel, drawn over the middle of a 466 px screen, so a background plate behind it only
// ever showed as a 53 px border and the picture a design had chosen was invisible in the
// part of the screen anybody looks at.
//
// Filled by the UI thread when the app is entered (it is the thread that decodes the plate)
// and read by the network task when it builds a frame. Kept for the life of the process
// rather than freed on exit, exactly like the road and coastline masks and for exactly the

// moment when one can be reading it while the other takes it away.

//
// Opening this app cold is not quick and never can be: it takes 1.2 MB of frame buffers,
// reads road tiles off the SD card, asks RainViewer which frames exist, then downloads and
// decodes five PNGs one at a time so the aircraft feed is not frozen for half a minute
// while it happens. That is fifteen to twenty seconds of work.
//
// For all of it, the screen used to show one line reading "ACQUIRING WX RADAR..." that was
// written once at construction and never touched again. A frozen string is exactly what a
// crashed device looks like, and there was no way to tell "downloading the fourth of five
// frames" from "the WiFi has gone" from "hung".
//
// The network task publishes its phase here and the UI reads it. Plain scalars on purpose:
// a torn read costs one frame of a slightly wrong progress count on a label that repaints
// twice a second, and that is a far better trade than putting a lock between two tasks that
// have no other reason to wait for each other.
