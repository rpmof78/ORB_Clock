# Why this exists. Studio ships four binaries and offers to flash them, and that copy was
# made by hand. On 2026-08-21 the bundle had drifted to a THEME_CAPS 5 build while the
# source was at 8, so Studio's own Flash button quietly rolled a device back three
# capability levels and reported "the newest there is" while doing it. Both builds call
# themselves v1.4.2, because FW_VERSION tracks releases and not what the firmware can read.
#
# So: never copy these by hand again, and always write down what the copy can do.

# BUILD contains, so until the site is rebuilt and deployed the flasher hands out whatever
# version was current the last time somebody ran vite build. The second time this happened,
# the Orb was flashed BACKWARDS over a newer build from the cable, which looks like the
# update silently failing.
#
# So the script says what is left rather than trusting anyone to remember, and it says it
# after checking, because a reminder that fires when it is not needed gets ignored.
